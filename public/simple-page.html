    <h1>A List of My Favorite Quotes</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>This is a list of quotes that have stuck by me for a long time.
        Here are my top 3 quotes:</h2>

    <p>One of my favorite quotes of all time come from the late Kobe Bryant. He said:
            <span style="color:rebeccapurple">
                <strong><q cite="https://www.goalcast.com/2018/12/28/kobe-bryant-quotes/">
                <sup>8</sup> Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity
                for me to rise.<sub>24</sub>
            </q></strong></span><br><br>

        Another quote that I like is by Grimsley from Pokemon Black and White. He said
            <span style="color:rebeccapurple">
                <strong><q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Grimsley/Quotes">
                Life is a serious battle, and you have to use the tools you're given.
                It's more important to master the cards you're holding than to complain
                about the ones your opponents were dealt.
            </q></strong></span><br><br>

        The third quote I have comes from my favorite basketball player, Stephen Curry. He said:
        <span style="color:rebeccapurple">
            <strong><q cite="https://www.goalcast.com/2018/10/05/15-stephen-curry-quotes/">
            If you don’t fall how are you going to know what getting up is like?
        </q></strong></span></p>
