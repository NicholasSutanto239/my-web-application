    <h1>A List of My Favorite Quotes</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is a list of quotes that have stuck by me for a long time.</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes of all time come from the late Kobe Bryant. He said:
            <span><q cite="https://www.goalcast.com/2018/12/28/kobe-bryant-quotes/">
                <sup>8</sup> negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity
                for me to rise.<sub>24</sub></q></span><br><br>

            Another quote that I like is by Grimsley from Pokemon Black and White. He said
            <span><q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Grimsley/Quotes">
                Life is a serious battle, and you have to use the tools you're given.
                It's more important to master the cards you're holding than to complain
                about the ones your opponents were dealt.</q></span>
